About UCL MotionInput v3


Please see www.touchlesscomputing.org to learn about this software and its features.
Please see Motioninput3-licence-v1.00.txt for licence terms.

This touchless computing journey has just begun!
This is Technical Preview software, is experimental and is not finished software.
Please expect the occasional glitches - use at your own risk!


This software will use your webcam and microphone, to calculate and relay gestures and speech as your keyboard and mouse.

You may need to change settings in your antivirus (and restart) to enable this technical preview software to operate.
Also you may have errors if you have more than one webcam plugged in.

No data is being transmitted online, all processing is done on your own machine.

We built this software over 3 years (with zero funds!) but a lot of inspired and motivated folks including tech communities have come on board. 
Please do reach out to us via our website if you wish to join and contribute to our growing community.

Thank you
The UCL MotionInput team
